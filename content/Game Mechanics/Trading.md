## General

- ? \[VERIFY.] Items sell for more at planetary trade outposts than they do at the space station Galactic Trade Terminal. It’s a good idea to build a teleporter to ones in high sell percentage systems!
	- You can easily find these using the Economy Scanner upgrade for your starship, or else by using a Planetary Chart (Inhabited Outpost) purchased from the Cartographer on any Space Station.
	- ? \[VERIFY.] The white line that connects the planet to the planet’s name and information takes you to a trading outpost on that planet. I saw a guy say this but anecdotally it doesn’t seem true…]]

## Tips

- If you sell you pilots who land, it won't crash the economy. 
- You can also supposedly sell at the trading post for more money.
