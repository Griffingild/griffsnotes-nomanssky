- These are timed community-wide events with exclusive unlocks. 
    
- There are two ways to begin one: (1) By creating a new save, (2) by loading in from an existing save. 
    
- When loading from an existing save, visit the Expedition Terminus on the Space Anomaly (behind the Nexus on the bottom floor). 
    

- This allows you bring 8 technology modules and 24 cargo with you. This becomes available by reaching the same terminal in the Expedition save. 
    

- All of this can be claimed once you reach the Space Anomaly in the Expedition.
    
- You are able to summon it once you warp to a new star system. 
    
- You can also make a copy of the multi-tool and primary starship you had active when you started the expedition. Each of these options costs Nanites, however.
    

- This essentially makes a save within your current save. 
    

- Recommended cargo to bring (Survival difficulty):
    

- Technology: Hazard protection upgrades (Coolant Network, Thermic Layer, Radiation Deflector, Toxin Suppressor), Personal Refiner MK 2, Launch  Auto-Charger, Teleport Receiver, Optical Drill, Advanced Mining Laser. 
    
- Cargo: Oxygen, Carbon, Condensed Carbon, Cobalt, Ionized Cobalt, Sodium, Sodium Nitrate, Ion Battery, Chromatic Metal, Gold, Life Support Gel, Unstable Plasma, Projectile Ammunition, Repair Kit, Projectile Ammunition, Uranium, Tritium or Pyrite, Starshield Battery.
    

- The following are NOT kept when you start an Expedition from an existing save:
    

- Difficulty settings. You will have to change these when the Expedition loads if you wish. But note that you cannot change inventory stack limits when a game has started. Some settings may also be set by the Expedition and can’t be changed. 
    
- Currency. Including Units, Nanites, and Quicksilver. 
    
- Freighter. 
    
- Current starship. You will be given a new one for the Expedition. You have to repair it just like you do with a new save. 
    
- Exosuit upgrades. For both technology and inventory slots. 
    
- (And anything else.)
    

- In your Menu (hit Esc), you will now see that you have an Expedition tab. This contains various Phases of the Expedition, each with its own Milestones. 
    

- You can complete Milestones for later Phases even if you haven’t reached them yet. So it’s worth looking at each Phase to see which ones you can complete together. 
    

- You CAN claim rewards from Milestones in later Phases when you complete them.
    

- Milestones offer various rewards to help you along the way in the Expedition.
    
- Completing a Phase also grants rewards. 
    

- When you begin, you are also given a new multi-tool with pre-loaded technology. 
    
- You will also have some starter items in your Exosuit inventory.

- You DO NOT keep recipes unlocked from the expedition when returning *to an existing save*. 
- You DO NOT keep space stations and bases from the TITAN expedition at least….
